# soundcloak
Frontend for SoundCloud

# About
- Designed to preserve your privacy. All requests to SoundCloud API are done server-side, without logging into an account. Media (tracks, images) can also be proxied if enabled by instance maintainer. No unnecessary requests or telemetry tracking your every move
- Lightweight and performant. Both server-side and client-side. Not far behind the official webapp, even faster in some cases
- Works without JavaScript (for most of the functionality)
- Pretty configurable. Both for instance maintainers, and for regular users
- URL scheme similar to SoundCloud's in most places
- It's also possible to download tracks, together with metadata
